Feedback to Matthew
=============================

This is an ask-me-anything Q&A repository.

I do a lot of [talks](https://speakerdeck.com/u/matthewmccullough) and posts about Git, GitHub tools, GitHub as a business, and [presenting](http://presentationpatterns.com). This is a perfect place to ask them in a way that the value of the discussion and answers are shared with the greater community.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you'll get the best and fastest response by [asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact). You can also drop in to the [GitHub Training](https://github.com/training) Team's next [free office hours](http://github.com/training/free) session.


Ask a question
------------------------------------

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/matthewmccullough/feedback/issues) on this project.

I'll answer it as soon as I can get to it, but that usually takes a few days. Once I answer, I'll close the issue so I know what I've responded to. But, don't worry -- if you have further questions, just respond in the issue thread and I'll get back to you. Feel free to ask a question on anany old issue too, even if you didn't create it originally.


Read some questions
------------------------------------

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/matthewmccullough/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1) filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.


Twitter
------------------------------------
If you have something quick, you can hit me up on Twitter with the clarifying 140 character limit. I'm [@matthewmccull](http://twitter.com/matthewmccull) on Twitter.
