Feedback to Matthew
=============================

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

I do a lot of talks and posts about How GitHub Works because I love talking and discussing how software gets built. So If you have any questions about GitHub, our culture, work practices, technical aspects, or questions about me in general, send 'em this way... I'd be happy to shed some light on the issue.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you'll get the best and fastest response by [asking GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact). You can also drop in to the [GitHub Training](https://github.com/training) Team's next [free office hours](http://github.com/training/free) session.


Ask a question
------------------------------------

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/matthewmccullough/feedback/issues) on this project.

I'll answer it as soon as I can get to it, but that usually takes a few days. Once I answer, I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.


Read some questions
------------------------------------

Check out the Closed Issues filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.


Twitter
------------------------------------
If you have something quick, you can hit me up on Twitter with the clarifying 140 character limit. I'm [@matthewmccull](http://twitter.com/matthewmccull) on Twitter.
